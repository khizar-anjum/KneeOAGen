things to focus on in the analysis

- the grading criterion is quite vague, the consequences for grading something to its nearby grades are far less than grading it to a faraway grade -- which would be very consequential
- no fatigue problem as in with physicians. 
- accuracy / confidence score? can we do something similar?
- preprocessing is needed before quantification as the zoom and the resolution would not be consistent.
